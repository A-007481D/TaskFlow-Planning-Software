### 1. **Welcome Homepage with Links and Overview**
   - **Purpose:** A welcome page could give new users an overview of TaskFlow's features, which is especially useful for onboarding. 
   - **Design Ideas:**
     - Display a brief summary or demo of the tool’s capabilities (e.g., task tracking, priority settings, drag-and-drop).
     - Include a “Get Started” or “Go to Dashboard” button linking to the planning interface.
     - Optionally add links to helpful sections like “How it Works,” “FAQs,” and “Contact Us.”
   - **User Flow:** After logging in, users see the welcome page. This could be especially engaging for new users, while returning users may have an option to go straight to their planning interface.

### 2. **Direct Access to Planning Interface (Dashboard)**
   - **Purpose:** A direct approach takes users straight to task management, which is practical if TaskFlow’s main feature is planning.
   - **Design Ideas:**
     - Design a clean, minimalist dashboard showing current tasks, project status, and upcoming deadlines.
     - Include navigation elements for quick access to “Add New Task,” “Task Filters,” and “Statistics.”
     - Consider a quick “Welcome” pop-up with tooltips guiding users on their first visit.
   - **User Flow:** Users are immediately in their workspace, which suits those looking for a fast, streamlined experience. 

### 3. **Hybrid Approach with Collapsible Sidebar**
   - **Purpose:** Combines a quick entry into task management with easy access to tutorials or help.
   - **Design Ideas:**
     - Users enter the planning interface directly, but a collapsible sidebar or dropdown provides access to “Welcome” content, user tips, and settings.
     - Optionally include a toggle to switch between “Beginner” and “Advanced” views, where beginners see onboarding tips and advanced users have a more streamlined layout.
   - **User Flow:** Users focus on planning while having easy access to guidance and extra features.

### 4. **Onboarding Wizard Followed by Dashboard Access**
   - **Purpose:** Ideal for first-time users needing guidance. The wizard introduces them to TaskFlow’s features, ensuring they know how to use it effectively.
   - **Design Ideas:**
     - Use a series of pop-ups or modal windows to guide users through setting up their first tasks, organizing the board, and configuring notifications.
     - End the onboarding with a link to the main dashboard.
   - **User Flow:** First-time users complete the onboarding and then go straight into their dashboard; returning users skip onboarding and land directly on the dashboard.

Depending on your users’ needs and your brand, each approach has its strengths! If TaskFlow aims to provide immediate productivity, the direct approach (Option 2) or hybrid (Option 3) could be most effective.
